# SOUNDBITES

SoundBites Cafe is the restaurant on the first floor of the new NPR headquarters. The cafe does some great stuff.

* It offers six different dishes every week.
* The menu is available for the whole week in advance.
* Each menu option is assigned a dietary value of red, yellow or green.

However, these great things have some problems, too.

* You can't see previous week menus.
* You can't sort by dietary value or any other aggregate.
* It's hard to see price or other trends.
* There's no comprehensive list of ingredients.

The soundbites app is here to solve these problems and more.

## Scraper

The scraper should be run once per week on Monday morning. It should not be run on days which are not Monday.

## Application

The application is a lightweight wrapper over MongoDB.

## Future application

There's much planned for soundbites.

* A dashboard showing price and dietary value trends.
* A mobile-friendly list of all meals available in the current/previous weeks.
* A POST-accepting server-side that allows users to favorite/rate menu items.
* A personalized menu planner.
